Introducing your Multi-Channel Telegram Update Bot

This Python program creates a clever Telegram bot that acts as a hub for updates from all your favorite channels!

Here's how it works:

    Connect your Telegram Account:

    The bot uses your Telegram account credentials (API ID, hash, and phone number) to securely interact with the platform. Don't worry, these details are stored safely and only used for authorized access.

    Select your Target Group:

    Choose a Telegram group chat where you want to receive updates from the channels. This becomes your central hub for all the exciting news!

    Add your Favorite Channels:

    The magic happens here! You can specify links to as many Telegram channels as you like. Simply provide the invite links (like "t.me/CoingraphNews") and the bot takes care of the rest.

    Real-time Updates, Delivered Fresh:

    The bot constantly monitors your chosen channels. Whenever a new message or media file appears, it gets whisked away and delivered straight to your target group chat. No need to manually check each channel anymore!

    Filtering for Clean Delivery:

    The bot acts as a smart filter. If a message already exists or doesn't contain a link (https://), it avoids duplicates and unnecessary notifications in your group chat.

    Flexibility and Customization:

    The program is designed to be easily modifiable. You can add more channels, change the target group, and adjust the waiting time between checks to perfectly suit your needs.

With this bot, you can stay on top of the latest updates from all your favorite channels in one convenient location. No more switching between apps or missing important news!

This is a fantastic tool for those who want to:

    Consolidate updates from various channels
    Keep a group chat informed about specific topics
    Automate information delivery within Telegram

Get ready to experience a streamlined and efficient way to stay updated with your favorite channels!
